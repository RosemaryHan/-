 * @Description
 * This time, you are supposed to find A+B where A and B are two polynomials.
 *
 * Input Specification:
 * Each input file contains one test case. Each case occupies 2 lines,
 * and each line contains the information of a polynomial:
 *
 * K N1 a
 * ​N
 * ​1
 * ​​
 * ​​  N
 * ​2
 * ​​  a
 * ​N
 * ​2
 * ​​
 * ​​  ... N
 * ​K
 * ​​  a
 * ​N
 * ​K
 * ​​
 * ​​
 *
 * where K is the number of nonzero terms in the polynomial, N
 * ​i
 * ​​  and a
 * ​N
 * ​i
 * ​​
 * ​​  (i=1,2,⋯,K) are the exponents and coefficients, respectively. It is given that 1≤K≤10，0≤N
 * ​K
 * ​​ <⋯<N
 * ​2
 * ​​ <N
 * ​1
 * ​​ ≤1000.
 *
 * Output Specification:
 * For each test case you should output the sum of A and B in one line, with the same format as the input. Notice that there must be NO extra space at the end of each line. Please be accurate to 1 decimal place.
 *
 * Sample Input:
 * 2 1 2.4 0 3.2
 * 2 2 1.5 1 0.5
 * Sample Output:
 * 3 2 1.5 1 2.9 0 3.2
